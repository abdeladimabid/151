# GenZDevs — Front-End CTF Challenge

Welcome, agent 👋
This repository contains a front-end **Capture the Flag (CTF)** challenge created for the **GenZDevs** class at YouCode. Your mission is to find the hidden admin **username** and **password** fragments inside the site’s front-end and piece them together to log in.

---

## 🔎 Challenge Summary

Some fragments of the admin credentials are hidden in the code of the site. You must analyze `index.html`, inspect the page, gather fragments, assemble the credentials, and use them to access the admin panel.

## 🧩 Rules

* ✅ Only inspect **`index.html`**. Do **not** open or inspect any other script files.
* ❌ No cheating — this challenge is about analysis, not peeking behind the curtain.
* 📸 After you log in successfully, take a screenshot of the admin panel as proof and share it with the class.
* 🤐 Do **not** post spoilers or the solution publicly — let everyone enjoy the puzzle.
* 😎 Have fun and be curious!

---

## 🛠️ What you need

* Basic knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JAVASCRIPT**.
* Comfort using browser **DevTools** (Elements, Search, Console).
* A text editor or note app to assemble credential fragments.

---

## 💡 Hints

* Look for unusual comments, attribute values, or hidden text.
* Pay attention to attribute names, class names, and inline hints.
* Collect fragments carefully — the full credential is assembled from multiple pieces.
